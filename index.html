<h1>Hello Infinity World Iam Rst </h1>
<h2>Types Of Beam</h2>
<h3>Hoe can we classify the beams</h3>
</head>
<body>
    <p>A beam is a structural element that primarily
       <b> resists loads</b> applied laterally across the beam's
        axis (an element designed to carry a load pushing
        <i>Parralell</i> to its axis would be a strut or column).
        Its mode of deflection is primarily by bending, as
        loads produce reaction forces at the beam's support
        points and internal bending moments, shear, stresses,
        strains, and deflections. </p>

        <p>1- Simply supported beam simply supported beam is supported at both ends. ...
            2- Continuous beam This beam is similar to a simply supported beam except more than two support are used on it. ...
            3- Overhanging beam The overhanging beam is a combination of a simply supported beam and a cantilever beam. ...
            4- Cantilever beam ...
            5- Fixed-beam ...</p>
