<h1>Hello Infinity World Iam Rst </h1>
<h2>Types Of Beam</h2>
<h3>How can we classify the beams</h3>
</head>
<body>
    <p>A beam is a structural element that primarily
       <b> resists loads</b> applied laterally across the beam's
        axis (an element designed to carry a load pushing
        <i>Parralell</i> to its axis would be a strut or column).
        Its mode of deflection is primarily by bending, as
        loads produce reaction forces at the beam's support
        points and internal bending moments, shear, stresses,
        strains, and deflections. </p>

        <h3>Purpose of beams</h3>
        <p>Beams are essential structural elements in construction, designed to support and distribute loads. They primarily resist bending forces, transferring weight from the floors, roofs, or walls to the columns and foundations. By doing so, beams help maintain the stability and integrity of a building, ensuring it can withstand various loads, including those from occupants, furniture, and environmental factors like wind or earthquakes12.
