<h2>Types Of Beam</h2>
</head>
<body>
    <p>A beam is a structural element that primarily
       <b> resists loads</b> applied laterally across the beam's
        axis (an element designed to carry a load pushing
        <i>Parralell</i> to its axis would be a strut or column).
        Its mode of deflection is primarily by bending, as
        loads produce reaction forces at the beam's support
        points and internal bending moments, shear, stresses,
        strains, and deflections. </p>
